# Server-Health-Monitoring-Automation-Platform
A complete DevOps-focused platform that enables secure, trackable, and observable execution of Linux infrastructure tasks with REST API support, system monitoring, and containerized deployment.

---

## 📌 What is This Project?

This platform is designed to:
- Monitor **server health metrics** such as CPU, memory, and disk usage
- Execute **automated Linux tasks** (e.g., disk cleanup, backup, restart services) via REST API
- Store **task execution logs** in PostgreSQL
- Visualize system and job-level metrics using **Grafana dashboards**
- Be fully **containerized with Docker** and **deployed with Kubernetes**
- Include **CI/CD automation via GitHub Actions**

---

## 💡 Why This Project?

DevOps, SRE, and infrastructure teams often face challenges such as:
- Manual SSH access to run scripts
- Lack of observability on jobs or scripts
- Cron jobs that silently fail with no logs
- No centralized place to manage and monitor infra-level tasks

This project solves these pain points by offering:
- A **central API interface** to safely execute predefined Linux tasks
- **Full logging** of job executions
- **Real-time system monitoring**
- Scalable deployment using Docker and Kubernetes
- **CI/CD integration** to streamline delivery and updates

---

## ⚙️ Key Features

- 🐍 Built with **Python (FastAPI)**
- 🖥️ Executes **Linux shell commands**
- 🌐 Exposes a secure **REST API** for job triggers and health data
- 🐘 Uses **PostgreSQL** to store job logs and system events
- 🐳 Containerized with **Docker**
- ☸️ Deployed using **Kubernetes** (YAML + Minikube or cloud)
- 📊 Integrates **Prometheus + Grafana** for observability
- 🔁 Automates builds & deployments using **GitHub Actions**

## 🆚 Advantages Over Traditional Approaches

| Traditional Approach             | This Project Improves It By...                      |
|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Manual SSH to run scripts        | Centralized API interface for secure job execution |
| Cron jobs with no visibility     | Logs every job run with success/failure tracking   |
| No monitoring of system health   | Exposes metrics and dashboards via Grafana         |
| Siloed scripts across servers    | Containerized + version-controlled tasks           |
| Hard to scale across environments| Kubernetes deployment for scalability              |

## 🧠 Why I Built This Project

As someone focused on DevOps and infrastructure automation, I wanted to:
- Build a tool that simulates **how real teams manage server health and automate jobs**
- Practice containerization and microservice deployment using **Docker and Kubernetes**
- Improve my skills in **Python, REST APIs, and shell scripting**
- Gain hands-on experience in observability tools like **Grafana and Prometheus**
- Create a **portfolio project** that is job-relevant, scalable, and impactful

---

## 📈 Real-World Use Cases

- Disk cleanup jobs triggered via API instead of cron
- Restart failed services or pods using API
- Monitor resource usage trends across servers
- Store logs for audits, rollbacks, and incident analysis
- Replace ad-hoc Bash scripts with centralized, trackable operations

---

## 📦 How to Run (Coming Soon)

> ⚙️ Instructions to build, run, and test the platform will be added in detail.

---

## 🔐 Security & Access (Optional Extensions)

- RBAC to restrict who can run which jobs
- OAuth or API key authentication
- Alerting via Slack or Email using Alertmanager
